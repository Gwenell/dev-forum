# Developer Forum: Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices, implemented security measures, and recommendations for securely deploying and maintaining the Developer Forum application.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Password Security

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using Argon2id, which is resistant to brute-force, GPU, and side-channel attacks
- **No Plain-text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text, logged, or exposed in API responses
- **Password Requirements**: Enforced minimum length (8 characters) and complexity
- **Rate Limiting**: Password attempts are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks

### JWT Implementation

- **Token Security**: JWTs are signed with a strong secret key
- **Short Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours by default
- **No Sensitive Data**: Tokens contain minimal user information (user ID, username, admin status)
- **Secure Transmission**: Tokens are only transmitted over HTTPS in production

### Authorization Controls

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for regular users and administrators
- **Resource-Based Authorization**: Users can only modify their own content unless they have admin privileges
- **Middleware Validation**: Authentication and authorization are validated at the middleware level

## API Security

### Input Validation

- **Request Validation**: All input is validated before processing
- **Sanitization**: User-generated content is sanitized to prevent XSS
- **Type Checking**: Strong type checking using Rust's type system
- **Error Messages**: Generic error messages that don't reveal system details

### Request Protection

- **CSRF Protection**: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests per time period
- **Request Size Limits**: Maximum size limits for requests to prevent DoS attacks
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper handling of request timeouts

### Response Security

- **Proper Headers**: Security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- **No Stack Traces**: Production error responses never include stack traces
- **Minimal Information**: Responses contain only necessary information

## Database Security

### Query Safety

- **ORM Usage**: Using Sea-ORM to prevent SQL injection
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterization
- **Minimal Privileges**: Database user has only required permissions
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient and secure database connection management

### Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted in the database
- **Audit Trail**: Important data changes are logged
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups with secure storage

## File Security

### Upload Protection

- **File Type Validation**: Restricting allowed file types
- **Size Limitations**: Maximum file size limits
- **Storage Location**: Files stored outside web root
- **Unique Filenames**: Generating unique filenames to prevent overwriting

### Malware Scanning

- **ClamAV Integration**: All uploaded files are scanned for malware
- **Quarantine Process**: Suspicious files are quarantined for review
- **Scan Logging**: File scanning results are logged
- **Failed Scan Handling**: Clear process for handling failed scans

## Network Security

### HTTPS Configuration

- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic must use HTTPS in production
- **Strong TLS**: Modern TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+)
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **Secure Cookies**: Cookies set with Secure and HttpOnly flags

### Firewall Configuration

- **Minimal Port Exposure**: Only necessary ports open (80, 443)
- **Rate Limiting**: Network-level rate limiting
- **IP Filtering**: Optional IP allowlisting for admin access
- **DDoS Protection**: Measures to mitigate DDoS attacks

## WebSocket Security

- **Authentication**: WebSocket connections require authentication
- **Message Validation**: All WebSocket messages are validated
- **Connection Limits**: Limits on WebSocket connections per user
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper handling of inactive connections

## Deployment Security

### Environment Management

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- **No Secrets in Code**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **Different Environments**: Separate configurations for development, testing, and production
- **Minimal Production Settings**: Debug mode disabled in production

### Container/Host Security

- **Minimal Base Image**: Using minimal base images for containers
- **Regular Updates**: Keeping system and dependencies updated
- **Process Isolation**: Running services with limited privileges
- **Resource Limitations**: Setting resource limits to prevent DoS

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Important events and security incidents logged
- **Log Protection**: Logs are protected from unauthorized access and tampering
- **No Sensitive Data**: No passwords or tokens in logs
- **Log Rotation**: Proper log rotation and retention policy

### Alerting

- **Security Alerts**: Alerts for suspicious activities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitoring for unusual server load
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Tracking for unusual error rates
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Alerts for service downtime

## Incident Response

### Preparation

- **Contact Information**: Maintaining current contact information for team members
- **Documentation**: Documented procedures for common security incidents
- **Escalation Path**: Clear escalation process for security issues
- **Backup Restoration**: Tested process for restoring from backups

### Response Process

1. **Identification**: Quickly identify potential security incidents
2. **Containment**: Contain the incident to prevent further damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Review and learn from the incident

## Regular Security Practices

- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies
- **Security Patches**: Promptly apply security patches
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Security Testing**: Regular security testing including:
  - Static code analysis
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Network security scanning
  - Penetration testing (as needed)

## Security Recommendations for Administrators

### Server Hardening

- **Minimal Services**: Run only necessary services
- **Account Security**: Strong passwords and MFA for server accounts
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the OS and software updated
- **Disk Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest

### Monitoring Considerations

- **Log Aggregation**: Consider using a log aggregation service
- **Intrusion Detection**: Consider implementing an IDS/IPS
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Monitor for unauthorized file changes
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual network traffic

### Backup Strategy

- **Regular Backups**: Implement automated, regular backups
- **Offsite Storage**: Store backups in multiple locations
- **Backup Testing**: Regularly test backup restoration
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive backup data

## Security Documentation

- **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**: Document how users can report security issues
- **Privacy Policy**: Clear policy on how user data is handled
- **Terms of Service**: Clear terms governing acceptable use
- **Security Contact**: Provide a security contact for vulnerability reports
